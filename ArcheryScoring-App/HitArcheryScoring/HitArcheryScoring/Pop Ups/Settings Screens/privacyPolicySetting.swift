This includes setting your profile picture, name, bow type, PRs, and all scoring rounds viewable on the History tab. If you choose to delete Rise from your device, any information saved in the app will be permanently deleted.\n\nIn the event that features are added to Rise in the future that impact how your data is saved or stored, this policy will be updated to reflect those changes."
