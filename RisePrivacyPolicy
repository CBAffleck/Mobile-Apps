Rise Archery App Privacy Policy

The privacy policy for the current version of Rise is pretty straightforward: any data you enter into the app 
is stored locally, on your phone, and can not be accessed by anyone else. This includes setting your profile 
picture, name, bow type, PRs, and all scoring rounds viewable on the History tab. If you choose to delete Rise 
from your device, any information saved in the app will be permanently deleted.

In the event that features are added to Rise in the future that impact how your data is saved or stored, this 
policy will be updated to reflect those changes.
