# Mobile Apps

This repo contains my mobile app projects. Currently these projects have all been developed in Android Studio for Android smartphones.

### Projects

* [Represent](#represent) - An app for users to discover, learn about, and contact their local representatives in Congress.
* [ElectricTime](#electrictime) - An app that converts speeds and distance coverage between electric modes of transportation.

### Summary

With this app, a user is able to discover the legislators that represent the district corresponding to either a zip code that can be input or the users' current location. A “surprise me” feature allows the user to view the legislators of districts corresponding to random zip codes around the United States.

### Features

Some things you can do with this app:

* View the members of congress and the senate that represent your district
* View the legislators of a random district
* Discover their party
* Go directly to their website or contact page
* See what committees and subcommittees they're a part of
* _Check if they're up for re-election [coming soon]_
* _Discover the bills they've recently sponsored [coming soon]_

### Summary

This app allows users to either input a distance and see how long it will take them to travel that distance using 1 of 10 methods of transport, or input a time and see how far they can travel in that time using the same methods of transport. These times and distances can also be compared with and converted to other transport options.
